### Performance

We're currently sending weekly email blasts of over 700,000 emails in 3-4 hours on a $10 p/m Digital Ocean VPS with 1gb memory and 1 core processor.

Mail for Good is fast and scales to the rate limit enforced by AWS.

### Why are we doing this?

We want to help nonprofits manage their email services without having to use third party services. These services can be pricey, both for importing emails and sending email campaigns. It is our goal to help nonprofit companies do more with their limited resources.
