Creating the blank instance
--------------

Right after you log in AWS you will land on this page

Scroll down until you see the "build a solution" box like below and select "Launch a virtual machine"
![](resources/deploy_images/2.png)

Click on the "Get started" button in the "EC2 Instance" box.

Give a name to your instance. In the example, we will go with "Mail-for-Good"

Select Ubuntu as your operating system
![](resources/deploy_images/5.png)

Here the preselected type of instance is fine.(t2.micro instances are eligible to the free tier)
![](resources/deploy_images/6.png)

AWS will create a pair of keys to your instance. You will have to supply this file every time you will want to log into your instance. Right now AWS is just asking for a name. For the example, we will go with "MfG-private-key". For the example, we will also store this file in our home. /home/{your username}/ also written ~/

Now AWS is creating your instance.

protocol: tcp
port range:8080
source: custom 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0



Deploying Mail for Good on your instance
---------
### Log into the instance
In the navbar at the top of your screen select "EC2" under the "Compute" category.
![](resources/deploy_images/10.png)
In the menu on the left of your screen, click on "Instances"
![](resources/deploy_images/11.png)
Select your instance then take note of the "Public DNS (IPv4)" of your application. In this case, ours is "ec2-54-77-4-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com"
![](resources/deploy_images/12.png)

In the following commands you will need to adapt what's put in between <> and remove the <>

Before using SSH you will need to make your key Publicly viewable by running
```
chmod 400 <path to your key>
```
Which would be the following command for our example
```
chmod 400 ~/MfG-private-key.pem
```

Use your terminal to log into your instance.
```
ssh -i "<path to the key file you downloaded earlier>" ubuntu@<your Public DNS (IPv4)
```
So, in our examle we would have to use thin command
```
ssh -i "~/MfG-private-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-54-77-4-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```

If everything went well so far you should have the following text displayed in your terminal
```
Welcome to Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.4.0-1030-aws x86_64)

```

You are now logged in your instance. All the next command are to be done while logged in your AWS instance.

### Installing docker and docker-compose on your instance
The installation process of docker is taken from here https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ check this for more details

update your apt package index :
```
$ sudo apt-get update
```
Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS:
```
$ sudo apt-get install \
 apt-transport-https \
 ca-certificates \
 curl \
 software-properties-common
```
Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key:
```
$ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
Install the docker version currently marked as "stable"
$ sudo add-apt-repository \
 "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
 $(lsb_release -cs) \
 stable"

To install docker-compose you need to run the next command
```
sudo apt-get install docker-compose
```

### Using docker-compose to launch Mail-for-Good
Import Mail-for-Good
```
git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/mail-for-good && cd Mail-for-Good
```

Create a .env file
```
cp .env.example
```

Then edit your .env according to the comments present in it.
(to quit, use Ctrl+X. Nano will ask  you to confirm then ask for the name of the file, don't change it)
```
nano .env
```

Launch Mail-for-Good
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

You may now put your "Public DNS (IPv4)" into the url bar of your browser followed by :8080 to land on your Mail-for-Good
In our example we would query "ec2-54-77-4-200.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080"
